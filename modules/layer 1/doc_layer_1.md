# Layer 1 (Interfaces)

TODO: Document

<!-- There role of interfaces is to provide the necessary prototype functions that may be required by CORE to access all devices peripherals and MCU-specific functionalities and information. Another NFC is that interface functions should be the only in- teraction between the two FW regions. This ensures functions to be independent and CORE modules to do not require any HW specific knowledge. -->
