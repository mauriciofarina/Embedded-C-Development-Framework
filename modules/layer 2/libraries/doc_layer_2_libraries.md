# Layer 2 (Libraries)

TODO: Document

<!-- 3) Libraries: Libraries are single instance components that may cluster a group of other components to implement a system functionality. Besides that, libraries can also be used to abstract third-party libraries or provide multi-thread imple- mentations. Basically, library components are presented into three types:
a) libraries: are components that provide higher level functionalities. To better exemplify this, Figure 2 shows a simplified design of a arm robot FW.
In this example depicted in Figure 2, Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) motor driver IC device instances are responsible for controlling the arm motors. Joint and Claw classes each instantiate a single instance of the driver device. 3 Joint Arm Robot Class inherits the Arm Robot Interface class and instantiate three Joint class and one Claw class objects. Next, Robot library instances one 3 Joint Arm Robot class Object and provide it with the necessary I2C functions. Finally, the library provides thread-safe access functions so that all tasks (applications) can control the robot in a shared matter.

b) Third-Party Libraries: are libraries that are not main- tained or developed in-house. Open-source or purchased li- braries are examples of this type of library. These libraries can not be consider part of the component layer. It is common to see third-party libraries being provided by code generator tools provided by vendors. Therefore, third-party libraries are an exception layer that can exist in both PROJECT and CORE.
The main disadvantage of using third-party libraries is that they may be limited to a certain domain. For example, a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) display library may be applicable for only a specific list of display devices. However, it may be necessary to replace the device display with a different unsupported model. Having third-party specific calls inside of the product code would then result in problems. For that reason, every third party should be abstracted by an Interface library.
c) Interface Libraries: are responsible for combining and standardizing other libraries or third-party libraries into a process flow. Following the previous LCD example, every display library would be added to the generic interface display library, which would provide abstracted display functions. The corresponding library selection can be made by the interface library by run-time implementation or in compile time.
For RTOS projects, the kernel itself should be seen as a third-party library, and, therefore, be abstracted by an inter- face library. Some vendors already provide kernel abstraction libraries. Unfortunately, these libraries are, usually, architec- ture specific. To avoid that, RTOS kernel should always be abstracted by an in-house library. -->
