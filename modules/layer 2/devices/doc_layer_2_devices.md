# Layer 2 (Devices)

TODO: Document

<!-- 1) Devices: Devices are components that represent Inte- grated Circuit (IC) peripherals and should always be external components. To allow the increase of their use domain, it is also expected that device implementations be bare-metal and allow multiple instances. Every device should provide a handler variable type with all information regarding a single instance. To operate devices, it is expected that this handler be passed as the first function argument, excusing the need of instance specific implementations. -->
